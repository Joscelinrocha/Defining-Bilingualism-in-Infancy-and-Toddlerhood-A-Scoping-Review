As predicted, monolingual children demonstrated a processing advantage, exemplified by a higher proportion of fixations to the target when initially focused on the distractor for correct pronunciations, relative to bilingual children. Con- trary to predictions, however, bilingual children exhibited weaker sensitivity to tone mispronuncia- tions compared with monolingual children. Third, time course analyses revealed that bilingual and monolingual children exhibited different patterns of relative sensitivity to vowel, consonant, and tone mispronunciations.

Monolingual and bilingual infants with comparable amounts of lan- guage input (i.e., monolinguals with low language input and bilinguals with high language input in one of their native languages) showed a neural pattern associated with the attentional mechanism preceding automatic processing of speech sounds. The neural patterns associated with the non-native speech contrasts suggested that both groups utilize their native phonologies to assimilate the foreign sounds. However, bi- lingual infants seemed to assimilate the non-native Chinese speech con- trast with greater ease, perhaps due to having 2 native phonologies.",﻿The patterns ofneural commitment associatedwith different degrees oflan- guage input in monolingual and bilingual infants were more similar when the relationship between the pMMR/nMMR was evaluated.

While infants being raised in monolingual environments do not generalize newwords across speakers who use different languages, infants being raised in multilingual environments find it partic- ularly surprising when speakers of different languages use the same word for the same object.

The youngest IMinfants showeda robust positivediscriminative response (pMMR) at superior sites and this pMMRdecreased in amplitude and latency with increasing age, similar to findings with tone contrasts (Morr et al., 2002). Many of the IM infants over 30 months of age showed negativity (nMMR) at some superior sites, particularly in the later time intervals. This negativity often followed a pMMR, and is likely to be the emerging MMN consistently observed in children older than 4 years of age and in adults (Lovio et al., 2009; N¨a¨at¨anen et","﻿the infants from bilingual (IB) backgrounds showed a
very different distribution for the pMMRand emerging nMMR.Many IB infants between 6 and 29 months of age showed more negative responses at superior sites between 200 and 400ms compared to the IM infants. For infants under 14months ofage, this nMMRwas parti- cularly large for IB females.Most ofthe IB toddlers between14 and 29 months ofage, whethermale or female, also showed increased nega- tivity oftheMMRsat superior sites, relative to theIM group. The older IB infants (30–46 months) showed similar patterns to the IM group, but the emerging nMMR,which is likely to be the precursor ofMMN, seems to onset at a later latency for a number of the IB compared to the IM 3-year olds. Below","﻿Our current analyses suggest that the nMMR/MMN will provide the important information regarding whether the nature of the input is sufficient for con- structing robust speech representations (extrinsic factors). In contrast, the P1 and the pMMR could indicate whether a child has a more general maturational delay (P1) or poor auditory acuity (pMMR) that can then lead to poor speech representations (intrin- sic factors). It is also possible that poor attention to speech at certain stages of development could lead to poor development of representations. We argued that the nature of the MMR (positive versus negative)
can reveal how infants are allocating attention to processing speech at different ages, and can provide information on whether native- language speech perception has become automatized.",idk,no,"Shafer, Valerie L.: vshafer@gc.cuny.edu","Shafer, V.
